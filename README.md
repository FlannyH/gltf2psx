# gltf2msh
This is a tool I wrote for converting a model from glTF format to a custom format I will use in my retro 3D projects. It was made with 32-bit systems like the PS1 in mind.

## File specifications
[Model PSX](./doc/model_psx.md) - The `.msh` file that this tool creates.

[Texture Atlas Pages PSX](./doc/texture_psx.md) - The `.tap` file that this tool creates
